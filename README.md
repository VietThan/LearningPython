# LearningPython
Detailing my journey on using Python <br> Since 22 August 2018
# 1. Why am I learning Python
I wanted to start automating some tasks. I'm a beginner and Reddit told me Python is pretty good. There are rojects in "TeaStuff" that hopefully will start going once I learn how to use Python with Google's API. Will be following http://automatetheboringstuff.com as the guide to my journey.
# Chapter 1
<b>(22 August) Using Notepad++</b><br>
For purely emotional reason, I wanted to try out Notepad++ though IDLE (the IDE that comes with the Python installation is good too). There is no more readily available Python plugin in Notepad++ 7.5.8. Used Run for a command line to open with:<br>
<code>C:\Python32\python.exe -i "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"</code>
<br><br>
Will still be using IDLE concurrently to check it out as well.
<br><br>
Welp, when I use Notepad++, for some reason using my number keys give me unicode characters like 1 turns to Äƒ. Can't find solution on google. Oh well, ends friendship with Notepad++, IDLE is now my best friend (unless I use PyCharm lol)

Summary of Chapter 1: Basic information about operators, expressions, arguments, variables, syntax.....Very basic CS1101Vanderbilt stuff. Most important thing <code>input()</code> take in as <code>strings</code> and <code>'hello'</code> can't be converted into a number.
