# LearningPython
Detailing my journey on using Python <br> Since 22 August 2018
# 1. Why am I learning Python
I wanted to start automating some tasks. I'm a beginner and Reddit told me Python is pretty good. There are rojects in "TeaStuff" that hopefully will start going once I learn how to use Python with Google's API. Will be following http://automatetheboringstuff.com as the guide to my journey.
# Chapter 1
<b>(22 August) Using Notepad++</b><br>
For purely emotional reason, I wanted to try out Notepad++ though IDLE (the IDE that comes with the Python installation is good too). There is no more readily available Python plugin in Notepad++ 7.5.8. Used Run for a command line to open with:<br>
<code>C:\Python32\python.exe -i "$(FULL_CURRENT_PATH)"</code>
<br><br>
Will still be using IDLE concurrently to check it out as well.
<br><br>
Welp, when I use Notepad++, for some reason using my number keys give me unicode characters like 1 turns to Äƒ. Can't find solution on google. Oh well, ends friendship with Notepad++, IDLE is now my best friend (unless I use PyCharm lol)
<br><br>
Summary of Chapter 1: Basic information about operators, expressions, arguments, variables, syntax.....Very basic CS1101Vanderbilt stuff. Most important thing <code>input()</code> take in as <code>strings</code> and <code>'hello'</code> can't be converted into a number.
# Chapter 2
<b>(24 August) More reviewing ahead</b><br>
Since the guide is written for programming-newbs, it is going through the same stuff I have learnt before. No sweat though, I need this kind of reviewing anyway for my Data Structures class this semester.
<br><br>
The syntax of python can seem easier (esepcially with Boolean) but then they throw in <code>in range()</code> which is funky for my Java and C++ background.
# Chapter 3
<b>(24 August)...got to Functions at least</b><br>
only one word to define/declare a function: <code>def</code>. Python is definitely easier than C++ and Java for newbies.
<br><br>
scope is a word I just started to appreciate
<br><br>
something I just noticed on python <code>print()</code> already have println()(Java) for you. Wow.
<br><br>
Take note to define a global variable with <code>global</code> and to All_CAPS them
<br><br>
I finally learnt to catch an error
<br><br>
Looking at the chapter names, I seem to still have a few days to go of review.
